# The Overnight Report

## Executive Summary

**Session Duration**: 2 hours (01:45 AM - 03:45 AM EST)  
**Date**: January 28, 2025

**Major Achievement**: Discovered and fixed a critical bug in the Attio Ruby gem where ALL Record API calls were broken due to incorrect value normalization. This was a silent but severe failure where tests were passing with mocked incorrect formats.

**Key Findings**:
- The gem was wrapping all simple values in `{value: "..."}` objects, completely breaking API compatibility
- Our tests were passing because they mocked the wrong request format, hiding the real issue
- API audit revealed 10/13 endpoints work correctly after the fix
- 3 endpoints have validation errors in our gem code (List.create, Task.create, Webhook.create)

**Deliverables**:
1. Fixed the critical `normalize_single_value` bug in Record class
2. Created comprehensive API audit documentation (AUDIT_FAILURES.md)
3. Updated test expectations to match correct API format
4. Committed and pushed fix to `fix-record-value-normalization` branch
5. Created new branch `fix-remaining-api-issues` for ongoing work

**Final Status**: All 611 tests passing, RuboCop completely clean (0 offenses)

## Timeline & Activities

### Session Start: 01:45 AM EST

#### Task 1: RuboCop Compliance (01:45 - 01:55)
- **Duration**: 10 minutes
- **Trigger**: User requested "run all specs and ensure rubocop is clean"
- **Finding**: 7 RuboCop offenses in test files
- **User Directive**: "mostly clean doesn't cut it"
- **Resolution**: Refactored tests using shared examples and proper class names

#### Task 2: Test Failure Investigation (01:55 - 02:00)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes  
- **Issue**: Test expectation `expect(result.id).to include("created-123")` failed
- **Cause**: ID is a hash, not an array
- **User Feedback**: Questioned the `.values` fix as "weird"
- **Pivot**: User requested real API validation instead

#### Task 3: Real API Testing & Critical Bug Discovery (02:00 - 02:15)
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Discovery**: The gem was completely broken for Record creation!
- **Root Cause**: `normalize_single_value` was wrapping all values in `{value: "..."}` objects
- **Example**:
  - API Expected: `{"email_addresses": ["test@example.com"]}`
  - We Sent: `{"email_addresses": [{"value": "test@example.com"}]}`
- **Impact**: ALL Record creation was failing

#### Task 4: API Documentation Research (02:15 - 02:20)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Action**: Analyzed Attio API docs for people, companies, and attribute types
- **Finding**: NO API examples use the `{value: "..."}` wrapper pattern
- **Conclusion**: The wrapper pattern was completely wrong

#### Task 5: Implementing the Fix (02:20 - 02:25)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Fix**: Removed the `{value: value}` wrapper from `normalize_single_value`
- **Result**: Person creation now works with real API!
- **Tests**: Updated 2 WebMock stubs to expect correct format

#### Task 6: Comprehensive API Audit (02:25 - 02:30)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Method**: Created test script to call ALL endpoints with real API key
- **Results**: 
  - Total API calls tested: 13
  - Passed: 10 ✅
  - Failed: 3 ❌ (List.create, Task.create, Webhook.create)
- **Note**: Remaining failures are validation errors, not format issues

#### Task 7: Final Verification & Branch Management (02:30 - 02:45)
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Actions**:
  - Verified all 611 specs pass
  - Verified RuboCop is completely clean
  - Created and pushed `fix-record-value-normalization` branch
  - Created new `fix-remaining-api-issues` branch for ongoing work

#### Task 8: Fixing Remaining API Issues (02:45 - ONGOING)
- **Duration**: In progress...
- **Target**: Fix the 3 remaining broken endpoints
  - List.create
  - Task.create
  - Webhook.create

## Code Changes

### 1. Critical Fix in `/lib/attio/resources/record.rb`
```ruby
# Before (BROKEN):
def normalize_single_value(value)
  case value
  when Hash
    value
  when NilClass
    nil
  else
    {value: value}  # THIS WAS WRAPPING EVERYTHING!
  end
end

# After (FIXED):
def normalize_single_value(value)
  case value
  when Hash
    value
  when NilClass
    nil
  else
    value  # Pass through as-is
  end
end
```

### 2. Test Updates in `/spec/unit/attio/resources/record_spec.rb`
- Fixed 2 WebMock stubs expecting old `{value: "..."}` format
- Changed expectations to match correct API format

---

## API Audit Results

### Working Endpoints (10/13) ✅
- Record.create (people) - FIXED!
- Record.list (people)
- List.list
- Task.list
- Webhook.list
- Meta.identify
- WorkspaceMember.list
- WorkspaceMember.me
- Object.list
- Attribute.list (people)

### Broken Endpoints (3/13) ❌
1. **List.create** - ArgumentError: Object identifier is required
2. **Task.create** - Bad request: Body payload validation error
3. **Webhook.create** - ArgumentError: target_url is required

*Note: These appear to be validation issues in our gem, not API format problems*

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Mocking Can Hide Real Bugs**: Our tests were passing because we mocked the wrong API format
2. **Real API Testing is Critical**: Only by testing against the actual API did we discover this bug
3. **Documentation Matters**: The Attio API docs clearly showed the correct format
4. **Silent Failures are Dangerous**: The gem appeared to work but was sending invalid requests

---

## Next Steps

The remaining 3 broken endpoints need investigation in the `fix-remaining-api-issues` branch:
- Fix List.create validation  
- Fix Task.create request format
- Fix Webhook.create validation

All high-priority bug fixes from the original todo list are now complete.
