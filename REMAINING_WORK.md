# Remaining Work for Attio Ruby SDK

This document outlines the work remaining to achieve complete API coverage for the Attio Ruby SDK.

## Current Status

✅ **Completed Resources (7/16):**
- Objects - Full CRUD operations
- Attributes - Full CRUD operations  
- Records - Full CRUD operations with batch support
- Lists - Full CRUD operations
- Workspace Members - Read operations
- Notes - Create, read, delete operations (immutable)
- Webhooks - Full CRUD operations

## Missing Core Resources

The following 9 core API endpoints are not yet implemented:

### 1. Entries
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** List entries (relationships between records)
- **Operations Needed:** List, retrieve, create, update, delete
- **Notes:** Critical for managing relationships between objects

### 2. Tasks
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Task management functionality
- **Operations Needed:** List, retrieve, create, update, delete
- **Notes:** Core CRM functionality for task tracking

### 3. Threads
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Conversation threads
- **Operations Needed:** List, retrieve, create, update, delete
- **Notes:** Communication tracking feature

### 4. Comments
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Comments on records/threads
- **Operations Needed:** List, retrieve, create, update, delete
- **Notes:** Related to Notes but likely separate functionality

### 5. Meta
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Metadata endpoints
- **Operations Needed:** TBD (likely read-only)
- **Notes:** System metadata, possibly read-only

### 6. People (Standard Object)
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Specialized People object endpoints
- **Operations Needed:** Investigate if different from Records API
- **Notes:** May have special endpoints beyond standard Records

### 7. Companies (Standard Object)
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Specialized Companies object endpoints
- **Operations Needed:** Investigate if different from Records API
- **Notes:** May have special endpoints beyond standard Records

### 8. Users
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** User management
- **Operations Needed:** List, retrieve, possibly update
- **Notes:** Likely admin/workspace management functionality

### 9. Deals (Standard Object)
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Deal/opportunity management
- **Operations Needed:** Investigate if different from Records API
- **Notes:** Core CRM functionality, may have special endpoints

### 10. Workspaces
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Workspace management
- **Operations Needed:** List, retrieve, possibly create/update
- **Notes:** Multi-tenant functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: High Priority (Core CRM Features)
1. **Entries** - Critical for relationship management
2. **Tasks** - Essential CRM functionality
3. **Deals** - Core sales functionality

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
1. **Threads** - Communication features
2. **Comments** - Collaboration features
3. **People/Companies** - Investigate specialized endpoints

### Phase 3: Low Priority (System/Admin Features)
1. **Meta** - System information
2. **Users** - User management
3. **Workspaces** - Multi-tenant support

## Technical Considerations

### Standard Object Investigation
For People, Companies, and Deals:
- These appear under "Standard objects" which suggests they may be accessible via the Records API
- Need to investigate if they have specialized endpoints beyond the standard Records CRUD
- May have unique query parameters, filtering, or additional operations

### API Pattern Consistency
- Follow established patterns from existing resources
- Maintain VCR test coverage for all new resources
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Follow Ruby gem conventions for method naming and parameters

### Testing Strategy
- Add VCR cassettes for all new endpoints
- Include comprehensive CRUD operation tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain 100% test coverage

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1:** ~2-3 days (3 high-priority resources)
- **Phase 2:** ~1-2 days (3 medium-priority resources)  
- **Phase 3:** ~1 day (3 low-priority resources)
- **Total:** ~4-6 days for complete API coverage

## Quality Standards

All new resources must meet the same standards as existing resources:
- ✅ Full VCR test coverage
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Parameter validation
- ✅ Ruby conventions
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Consistent API patterns

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize which resources to implement first based on user needs
2. Investigate Standard Objects (People, Companies, Deals) to understand their relationship to the Records API
3. Begin implementation with the Entries resource as it's critical for relationship management
4. Maintain the high quality standards established in the current codebase
